# Moebius XBIN GJ Edition (fork)
Moebius XBIN is an XBIN Editor for MacOS, Linux and Windows. This is a forked version of [Moebius XBIN](https://github.com/hlotvonen/moebius) which itself is a fork of [Moebius](https://github.com/blocktronics/moebius). 

- `Moebius` is the original program.
- `Moebius XBIN` extends the original and contains support for custom colors and character sets and saving and loading xbin files (hence the name)
- `Moebius XBIN GJ Edition` which originally was just me wanting to stop the function keys fro re-mapping -- but now has become a bit more.

## Moebius XBIN GJ Edition:
- Stops the function keys from being remapped when clicking in the character list.
- Makes default font IBM VGA instead of TOPAZ 437 (preference)
- Lets you use the character list picker to load the custom paint brush block.
- Adds opacity adjustment for the reference image with `SHIFT+Mouse Wheel`
- Adds opacity adjustment for drawing grids and guides with `ALT+Mouse Wheel`
- Adds a 1x1 drawing grid
- Adds character code to status bar
- ... more things to come perhaps!
